## MFU-WP01-08-UAT: Phase 1 End-to-End

## MFU Identification

- MFU ID: MFU-WP01-08-UAT
- Title: Phase 1 End-to-End
- Date Created: 2025-09-25
- Created By: TalkAvocado Team
- Work Package: WP01 — POC Pipeline
- Sprint: Phase 1 – UAT

## MFU Definition

**Functional Description**:
Validate full pipeline across at least 3 samples and 2 tenants; capture thresholds and sign-off.

**Technical Scope**:

- Execute pipeline via Job API from upload → `final_poc.mp4` + `captions.final.srt`
- Cover short/medium/long samples; test multi-tenant isolation
- Capture known issues and thresholds; produce demo plan

**Business Value**  
Demonstrates POC viability, de-risks multi-tenant handling, and provides clear success metrics for stakeholders.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Pipeline runs end-to-end; artifacts produced as expected
- [ ] Success on short/medium/long samples; no cross-tenant collisions
- [ ] Known issues and thresholds documented; stakeholder demo passes

## Complexity Assessment

- Complexity: Medium
- Estimated Effort: 1–2 days
- Confidence: Medium

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Depends on: MFU-WP01-01 → MFU-WP01-07

## Agent Execution Guide (Step-by-step)

1) Prepare two tenants and three sample sizes
2) Run pipeline via Job API; collect metrics (durations, costs)
3) Validate outputs (durations, sync, transitions, branding, captions)
4) Summarize findings and obtain sign-off

## Test Plan

- Execute e2e for Tenant A and B; compare durations, check sync and transitions, confirm branding and captions

## Success Metrics

- All acceptance checks pass; stakeholders sign off

## Implementation Tracking

- Status: planned
- Assigned To: Team
- Start Date: 2025-09-25
- Target Completion: +2 days
- Actual Completion: TBC
